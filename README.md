# dotfiles
Collection of useful dotfiles.

## Installation
The easiest way to give the dotfiles located within this repo a try is to simply clone it with: `git clone https://github.com/eKirad/dotfiles.git`

## Usage
In order to use the dotfiles, one would either need to move each file to `~/` or use a symlink.

### Aliases
Note that in order to use the `alias`-es defined in the corresponding (`.aliases`) dotfile, one would need to include it in the shell startup file(s), like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
Additionally, some of the `git` aliases assume an installed `gitmoji`[^1]. Please refer to the official documentation for further details and installation instructions.
